# sonar-classification
Using Google Colab, develop a machine learning model to classify objects detected by sonar signals as either mines or rocks, leveraging the Sonar Dataset.

## This project was created to be runed on google colab but can be runed on Jupiter notebook.
You will possibly need to change the paths of the files on the three notebooks.
